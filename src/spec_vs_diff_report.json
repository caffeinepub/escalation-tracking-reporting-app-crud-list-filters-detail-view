  "summary": "The diff clearly updates the Escalations table View navigation to use a backend-provided escalation identifier (bigint -> string route param) and updates React Query keys/mutations to use escalationId rather than an index. However, the diff evidence does not show the corresponding route-param parsing/usage updates in the detail/edit pages/components, so end-to-end ID consistency across list/detail/edit routing cannot be fully verified from the provided changes. Several unrelated filtering/status/date-handling changes also appear.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Update the frontend data flow and types so that list results carry and consistently use the real escalation ID returned by the backend (e.g., escalationId) across list, detail, edit, and delete operations (routing params, React Query keys, and mutation inputs).",
      "reason": "The diff shows React Query keys and delete/update mutations using escalationId, and the list table navigation uses an escalationId param, but there is no diff evidence for corresponding changes in the detail/edit pages/components to ensure the same identifier is parsed from the route and passed through consistently (routing params end-to-end). With only the shown modified files, this cannot be confirmed.",
