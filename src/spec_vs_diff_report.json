  "summary": "Diff implements all three requested fixes: (REQ-8) LoginPage now renders a visible sign-in error message and provides a retry action; (REQ-9) App root layout now renders an authenticated bootstrap error view with a logout recovery action when getCallerUserProfile fails; (REQ-10) backend authorization now allows any non-anonymous principal to call getCallerUserProfile and escalation CRUD while still trapping anonymous callers.",

      "reason": "REQ-9 requires providing a \"Log out\" action via the existing auth clear/logout flow, but does not explicitly request clearing the query cache; this is an extra behavior added beyond the stated acceptance criteria.",
